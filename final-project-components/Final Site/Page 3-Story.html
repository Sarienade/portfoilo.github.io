<p>Throughout the years, the concept of life requiring “spark” has been an idea shared with many. This “spark” is theorized to take the form of passion, purpose, or even power. Many claim to have a spark, something which drives them to continue living and experiencing the world around them. But there is then a question; where do these sparks come from? Our theory? They are passed down from those who have come before us. </p>
<p>Sparks are the will to live and thrive found in all living things. There is a limited quantity of them, and they are constantly shifting into different hosts at a specific time; a simultaneous moment of death to one life and the beginning of another. A spark’s task is simple; learn and understand what it means to be alive. To truly understand, a spark must begin at square-one. Starting as a single-celled organism, sparks learn how fleeting life can be. From there, a spark takes millions of lifetimes to fully develop, confronting the infinite number of possible experiences until it finally understands what it means to live and passes. </p>
<p>From there, the spark dissipates, a multitude of new sparks emerging from the old and beginning the cycle once again.</p>
