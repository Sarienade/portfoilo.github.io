<h2>The Halting of Historical Repetition by Psychological Means</h2>
<p>The phrase “history is doomed to repeat itself” has been used through society and culture for generations. It calls for audiences to reflect on their responses to events in their lives and use the past as a reference on what to do and what NOT to do. </p>
<p>These moments are not only found in common knowledge of history, but rather the previous lessons one’s spark has learned over time. </p>
<p>A common example is the idea of the Uncanny Valley. Many subjects report having the innate fear of non-human figures displaying human features. The Sparks theory is used to explain this occurrence as one’s spark keeping their host from danger as it informs them of the risk of approaching something from the liminal valley. </p>
<p>Irrational fear and phobias also support the theory of sparks, as there has always been the question as to why phobias form within individuals. These fears come from a spark’s previous experiences and its desire to keep its host away from reliving negative experiences of the past. </p>
<p>Looking at the course of history, there have been multiple instances of using the thought processes of the past to stay informed of the present. A spark’s existence is dependent on its ability to learn as much it can from its current experience, meaning it must stay alive for as long as possible to understand the world around it and collect data for its next cycle before death.  </p>
<p>This data and research allow for individualized practices and situations, meaning tragedy can be stopped before it occurs.  
Taking these discoveries and utilizing them in day-to-day life also allows for one to eliminate frustrations as to “why” they may fear the world and become accepting that fear is an opportunity to learn or relearn a piece of information vital to survival.  </p>

<h2>One’s Purpose </h2>
<p>Religion can be defined as a system of faith and worship. It can also be defined as an ignorant response to the world around them. However, many denominations consider the idea of a soul and the existence of life outside of a body. </p>
<p>Plato states, “the soul is what gives each person their essence and allows them to consciously make decisions and actions”. </p>
<p>The idea of a soul is the basis of a spark, with the difference being a spark is a collection of knowledge and experience rather than an actual consciousness. </p>
<p>Religion features morals and values a person must have to live a life of contentment and fulfillment, but there are many who search for those end goals without joining a faith. </p>
    <p>Sparks are not exclusive to those who follow a faith; anything that is alive has a spark since anything that has alive has freedom of choice. </p>

<h2>Sparks: The Key to Survival</h2>
<p>History records certain miracles, including individuals being brought back from the dead by pure chance and determination. Scientific phenomenon such as “adrenaline rushes” and “gut feelings” have research and logic backing them up in arguments, allowing audiences to understand how, why, and when they occur. The mind, however, is still a mystery to the common man.  </p>
<p>The theory of sparks is used as the missing piece to create an understanding as to why the mind fights to survive the unsurvivable and why one cannot return to a living state after passing. </p>
<p>The experiments in Mary Shelly’s “Frankenstein” have been proven to be fictional, in the sense that one cannot place deceased anatomy together and create new life. The same is the case with an intact corpse; life cannot be placed into cadavers. However, science allows and is successful with the transplants of limbs and organs to living hosts.</p>
<p>This idea is the core of a spark’s ability. It will adapt and use energy to preserve itself in the host it currently inhabits. However, when the body reaches its physical limit, the spark has no choice but to shift to its next host, a brand-new life entirely. </p>
<p>This would explain the idea of a “will to live”. A spark is the electric energy found within the ions of cell membranes. This energy, specific to living bodies, allows the brain to function and provide information and purpose to one’s organs. When the body and mind begin to fail, a spark will provide more energy as a “last hurrah” as a last effort to preserve the body it inhabits. Upon reaching its limit, the spark flees, taking all energy with it and leaving the body lifeless. </p>
