<h2>The Halting of Historical Repetition by Psychological Means</h2>
<p>The phrase “history is doomed to repeat itself” has been used through society and culture for generations. It calls for audiences to reflect on their responses to events in their lives and use the past as a reference on what to do and what NOT to do. </p>
<p>These moments are not only found in common knowledge of history, but rather the previous lessons one’s spark has learned over time. </p>
<p>A common example is the idea of the Uncanny Valley. Many subjects report having the innate fear of non-human figures displaying human features. The Sparks theory is used to explain this occurrence as one’s spark keeping their host from danger as it informs them of the risk of approaching something from the liminal valley. </p>
<p>Irrational fear and phobias also support the theory of sparks, as there has always been the question as to why phobias form within individuals. These fears come from a spark’s previous experiences and its desire to keep its host away from reliving negative experiences of the past. </p>
<p>Looking at the course of history, there have been multiple instances of using the thought processes of the past to stay informed of the present. A spark’s existence is dependent on its ability to learn as much it can from its current experience, meaning it must stay alive for as long as possible to understand the world around it and collect data for its next cycle before death.  </p>
<p>This data and research allow for individualized practices and situations, meaning tragedy can be stopped before it occurs.  
Taking these discoveries and utilizing them in day-to-day life also allows for one to eliminate frustrations as to “why” they may fear the world and become accepting that fear is an opportunity to learn or relearn a piece of information vital to survival.  </p>

<h2>One’s Purpose </h2>
<p>Religion can be defined as a system of faith and worship. It can also be defined as an ignorant response to the world around them. However, many denominations consider the idea of a soul and the existence of life outside of a body. </p>
<p>Plato states, “the soul is what gives each person their essence and allows them to consciously make decisions and actions”. </p>
<p>The idea of a soul is the basis of a spark, with the difference being a spark is a collection of knowledge and experience rather than an actual consciousness. </p>
<p>Religion features morals and values a person must have to live a life of contentment and fulfillment, but there are many who search for those end goals without joining a faith. </p>
    <p>Sparks are not exclusive to those who follow a faith; anything that is alive has a spark since anything that has alive has freedom of choice. </p>
