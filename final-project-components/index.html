<p>LYTE is scientifically based company rooted in discovering how individuals' function and thrive, how morals are created, cataloguing the numerous archetypes found within the world, and utilizing said information to create a world that values all lives.</p>

<p>At its core, LYTE works to relate to the thousands of people who need a reason to live. Negativity and the loss of purpose plague the people of this century as we cope with the plateau of progress; LYTE and the theory of sparks develop in order to convince the world that progress and purpose is ongoing and infinite. We here at LYTE bridge the gap between
science and faith; we pride ourselves in not devoting ourselves to any specific religion but rather use the history and values of each denomination to further our research on the human will and the definition of fulfillment and enlightenment.</p>
<p>With this information, LYTE expediates a sparkâ€™s journey, allowing the individual they
inhabit to experience fulfillment and peace long before the end of their life.</p>
