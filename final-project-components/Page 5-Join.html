<h2>We’d love to have you! </h2>
<p>You can get involved by emailing us at fellowship@LYTE.com</p>
<p>Please provide us with a briefing on yourself as well as your spark’s story. Do you seek fulfillment? Do you aspire to be more? Let us know what you wish to discover from us.
From there, we will provide you with an application contract as well as discuss payment options. We offer several payment plans including annual, monthly, and interest driven loans. These payments go towards our research, panels, and publications, and services to you, allowing us to dive into discovering more about your individual spark, what is needed for it to be nurtured, and what you as a person need to do to keep yourself safe and content as you live through your current experience.
