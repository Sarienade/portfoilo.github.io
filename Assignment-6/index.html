<p>"The problem with dating Harvey is his reserved, practical demeanor, which might lack the passion some players desire. Adding to the challenge is his aversion to popular treats like cookies and pancakes, making gift-giving tricky.</p>

<p>Harvey is undoubtedly one of the more popular bachelors in Stardew Valley, but that doesn't mean dating him is easy. His level-headed personality can be a hurdle for players seeking a passionate romance; after all, heâ€™s just a nice guy content with spending quality time with the townspeople.</p>
      
<p>Another challenge in dating Harvey is his peculiar dislikes. He isn't fond of universally appreciated treats like cookies, cakes, pies, and pancakes. This unusual preference, paired with his mostly predictable and "normie" reactions to life events, can make him a surprisingly difficult bachelor to connect with."</p>

<p>Being one of the older bachelors, Harvey is personified as a simple, level-headed gentleman who aids the citizens of the valley in medical care. As an older NPC, his tastes within the game reflect his age, making his choices for loved gifts an adventure for players who pursue him to discover and enjoy. Additionally, after a player has a sense of what items cause Harvey's fondness of you to grow, the doctor simply leaves you to your journey through the valley and allows a player's experience to be one that does not center around tending to a love interest's "needs". </p>

<p>The eligible bachelors of Stardew Valley fall into certain stereotypes in order for a player's choice to be as simple as possible. Examples of these stereotypes include Sebastian (Emo), Alex (Jock), and Shane (Drunk). As blatant as this claim is, the character's designs and immediate personalities mirror fit the bill. Harvey's stereotype is the "nerd", leading him to focus on work, his interests, and resulting in him struggling with social interactions. These traits cause some players to conclude he is devoid of romantic tendencies and personality. But to others, myself included, this depiction of just a genuinely nice guy who has a personality other than revolving around their partner can be refreshing and endearing. </p>
      
<p>In concerns to the difficulty of creating, buying, or finding items Harvey is fond of, my argument is as follows; Harvey is the best love interest option for those who are looking to explore everything Stardew Valley has to offer. There are dozens of facets to consider, discover, and enjoy, and the rarity and value of the gifts Harvey enjoys allows the player to not only gain the favor of their favorite bachelor, but also level up their skills, uncover secrets and extra information, and end the run with a prosperous farm AND a doting husband.</p>
