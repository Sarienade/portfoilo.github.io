    <p>     As someone born in the early 2000’s, I had a front row seat to the shift of technology, as well as the visual metamorphosis pages and sites experienced as they moved with the ages. By the time I was given permission from my mother to explore the web independently, the age of apps and bright white, uniform layouts had arrived. There were pieces of the internet many are still so nostalgic over present, but algorithms took away the adventure of finding new pages, topics, and people to connect with. Every app seemed to be the same. Swipe; oooh that’s nice! Swipe; that’s cool! Swipe, swipe, swipe. Nothing stuck out to me, and thus I was sucked into a habit so many of us have become a victim of: doom-scrolling. There are days, like today while reading this article, where I hear others reminisce on what the web used to be. Endless searches, customization, collection of cherished memories and communities packed to the brim with kindred spirits. There was never a moment of “doom-scrolling” because there was always a purpose as to why you were online. But this version of the web is a thing of the past. Kate Wagner’s article, 404: Page Not Found, touches on a simple reality: the usage of the internet today is solely dependent on the chance it can be used for profit by those who have enough power, money, and influence. </p>
    
    <p>     Companies such as Facebook and Instagram became responses to the demand for simplified, organized digital spaces, something easy to use and maneuver around. As other companies began to realize they could better market their product using the data provided by online audiences, they would approach these social media companies in order to create deals to profit them both. In doing so, audiences wanting to stay off of or separate themselves from the "ghetto” Myspace would unknowingly become guinea pigs for advertising and marketing due to voluntarily relinquishing their data. “In choosing Facebook, these users not only relinquished the creative flexibility of Myspace, they also, we now know, forfeited their privacy.” (Wagner 2019) When learning this as I grew older, I couldn’t help but feel spiteful. I had unknowingly given the thumbs-up to have my privacy infiltrated, which then affected and molded my personal experience on the internet to benefit companies trying to sell pens and shirts and highly specific stuffed animals. </p>
    
    <p>  Despite my frustration, I understand this development was a natural one; it only makes sense for those running a business to utilize the resources around them to create a streamline of customers and consumers. It’s just disheartening to realize the communities built up of hundreds and thousands of people connecting from across the world due to their passion of topics, hobbies, and conversations no longer exist in this era. What’s more is the idea the spaces that do choose to replicate and reanimate the web of yesterday fall short of the mark due to the need to be marketable or successful. “Non-virality and false obsolescence, when combined with link rot—the natural atrophy of links across time—have led to the quiet erasure of entire swaths of the internet.” (Wagner 2019) When reading Wagner’s article, I was reminded of another piece I had read from BJ Colangelo titled The Bleak Future Of Streaming Suggests A World Without Cult Classics. This article speaks on the world of streaming and how easy it was for companies such as Hulu, Netflix, and Roku to release experimental shows and movies and then quickly erase any existence of them if they are not an immediate success. So much so, that production companies such as Paramount, Disney, and Universal hopped on the bandwagon and released their own platforms to capitalize on this loophole for their taxes. The article centers around a viral tweet from Miller Ross which comments on these actions; "There will never be another cult classic. If your movie or show underperforms, it will be removed from sight, and that eventual groundswell of support that's turned everything from 'Blade Runner' to 'Heathers' from disastrous flops to huge successes will never find it. The end." (Ross 2023) Just like how “Heathers” had become a beloved movie through rewatches and growing appeal years after its release, Myspace had done the same in terms of growing a following through the chaos of creating a personalized experience. “The assumption that the attributes of Myspace were the sole domain of the tween doesn’t fit at all with the truth; many former users still care about these glittery sites because they were able to make them truly their own.” (Wagner 2019)</p>
