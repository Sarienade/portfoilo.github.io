<p>Dr. Baddie Lyte, the namesake of LYTE, nurtured her spark to the very end. Pushing herself into religious and psychological studies after a childhood filled with examples of addiction and loss, Baddie would ponder on why the systems and beliefs within this world focus on individuals becoming the most useful version of themselves for society rather than focus on finding the specific aspects of life that could lead one to finding purpose and peace. </p>

<p>Devoting her time to interviewing a variety of subjects, from a reveled professor in STEM, Dr. Shithead Cooper to infamous criminals such as Kirby Cleans, Baddie Lyte began what would become the most extensive collection of personalities, attributes, and values ever created. Along with this, Dr. Baddie Lyte connected this array of discoveries to the values of religion and morals and found distinct reoccurrences in behavior dependent on certain aspects of personality, interests, and subject knowledge shared by individuals living centuries apart. </p>

<p>With this research on hand, Dr. Lyte was then able to identify behavioral patterns and correctly determine courses of action individuals take to find contentment in their lives, leading to swift diagnoses and assistance to those about to take drastic action, preventing history from repeating itself.  Dr. Baddie Lyte saved lives and created purpose with her research, founding LYTE to continue furthering her discoveries and help others kindle their spark and find their purpose.</p>
